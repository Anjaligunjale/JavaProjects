# 📌 Employee Management System (Java Console Application)

## 📖 Overview

The Employee Management System is a simple Java console-based
application built to manage basic employee information. This project
demonstrates core Java concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming
(OOP), collections, exception handling, and modular program structure.
Users can add, view, update, and delete employee records through an
interactive menu-driven interface.

This project was created as part of hands-on learning and project work
to apply Java fundamentals in a real-world scenario.

## 🚀 Features

-   ➕ Add new employee records\
-   📄 View all stored employee details\
-   ✏️ Update an existing employee's information\
-   ❌ Delete an employee record\
-   📂 Uses `ArrayList` for efficient data storage\
-   🧱 Built using OOP principles\
-   🎯 Easy-to-use menu interface

## 🛠 Technologies Used

-   Java (JDK 8+/17+)\
-   OOP Concepts\
-   Java Collections (ArrayList)\
-   Exception Handling

2. View Employees\
3. Update Employee\
4. Delete Employee\
5. Exit

Data is stored in memory using an `ArrayList<Employee>`.
